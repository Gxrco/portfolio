# Portfolio

My portfolio is an evidence of my journey with modern Web Development tools. I've been working with node.js and React to build fullstack solutions with other multiples libraries and frameworks to complement.

My experience with UX/UI has given me notions of design, style and layouting for my websites/apps, this is important to set up projects with protoypes and tests to asure the final quality of the product.
